Problem statements 

Create a predictive model using Gradient boosting to forcasting housing 
prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, 
number of bathrooms, and location.

The features to be considered include:

1.Square footage: Total area of the property.

2.Number of bedrooms: The count of bedrooms in the property.

3.Number of bathrooms: The count of bathrooms in the property.

4.Location: Geographic information or neighborhood where the property is situated.

Objectives:

.Build a robust Gradient Boosting model that leverages the provided dataset to forecast housing 
prices.

.Identify the relative importance of various features in influencing housing prices.

.Use advanced ensemble techniques to handle complex, non-linear relationships between the 
features and target variable (housing prices).

.Provide actionable insights for pricing strategies and market analysis.

Benefits:

.Real estate professionals and customers can make informed pricing decisions.

.Stakeholders can identify key factors driving housing prices in different markets.

.The model can serve as a foundation for developing tools to simulate and predict price changes 
based on market trends.
